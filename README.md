  > [!NOTE]
  > Since the `stylelint-config-standard-scss` package extends the `stylelint-config-standard` package, using both may be redundant and problematic. It could result in having two versions of the same dependency in your project, which can cause issues if you update only one of them. However, it can still be useful to have access to new rules provided by this package. Make sure to pay attention to this in your project.
- [`stylelint-config-recess-order`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/stylelint-config-recess-order) - Config that sorts related property declarations by grouping together in the rational order

### CI

  Expanded by [`cz-conventional-changelog`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cz-conventional-changelog) - A commitizen propmpts adapter for the Angular version of [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)

- #### [`semantic-release`](https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/semantic-release/)

  Automates the whole package release workflow including: determining the next version number, generating the release notes, and upgrading the package version. It has its own config, which is located in [`.releaserc.json`](./.releaserc.json) - [config description](https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/semantic-release/usage/configuration). This package is primarily used in a [CI environment](./.github/workflows/release.yml)

  ##### Plugins

  - [`@semantic-release/commit-analyzer`](https://github.com/semantic-release/commit-analyzer) - plugin to analyze commits with conventional-changelog. _(You do not need to install this plugin. semantic-release comes with this plugin out of the box)_. Expanded by `conventional-changelog-conventionalcommits`
    > [!NOTE]
    > Since this is project-specific, I've decided to label the "chore" type as a patch release (`{ "type": "chore", "release": "patch" }`), which is typically used for updating packages To allow for the possibility of "chore" breaking releases, add the following rule above (`{ "type": "chore", "release": "patch" }`) for correct rule applies. If you want to use deafult preset settings, you could delete this two lines.
  - [`@semantic-release/release-notes-generator`](https://github.com/semantic-release/release-notes-generator) - plugin to generate changelog content with conventional-changelog _(You do not need to install this plugin. semantic-release comes with this plugin out of the box)_. Expanded by `conventional-changelog-conventionalcommits`
  - [`@semantic-release/changelog`](https://github.com/semantic-release/changelog) - plugin to create or update a changelog file
  - [`@semantic-release/npm`](https://github.com/semantic-release/npm) - plugin to publish a npm package and bump version in `package.json`

    > [!NOTE]
    > Since this project is not a package for publication. This plugin is only needed to update the version in package.json ([this is regulated by `private: true` in package.json](https://github.com/semantic-release/npm#options))

  - [`@semantic-release/github`](https://github.com/semantic-release/github) - plugin to publish a GitHub release and comment on released Pull Requests/Issues. _(You do not need to install this plugin. semantic-release comes with this plugin out of the box)_
  - [`@semantic-release/git`](https://github.com/semantic-release/git) - plugin to commit release assets \ tag version to the project's git repository

  ##### Preset

  - [`conventional-changelog-conventionalcommits`](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog/tree/master/packages/conventional-changelog-conventionalcommits) - same preset that used for `commitizen` (`cz-conventional-changelog`) and `commitlint` (`@commitlint/config-conventional`). Since I have overridden the angular preset used by semantic-release by default, it must be declared in direct dependencies.

### [Plop](https://plopjs.com/)

- [`plop`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/plop) - micro-generator framework that makes it easy to create files

## ⚠️ Requirements ⚠️

Since some Webpack, ESLint plugins or other dev tools like (`semantic-release`) require `Node.js` version ≥ `18.17`. you need [`Node.js 18.17 and above`](https://nodejs.org/en/) to prepare for future changes. Check recommended version in [.nvmrc](./.nvmrc). You also may need [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started/), if you want run production build

## ⏬ Installation

1. Clone or download the repo
2. Browse the downloaded directory
3. Install dependencies through `npm`
   ```bash
    npm i
   ```

## ⏩ Commands

### Development environment

One-time development build:

```bash
  npm run dev
```

Watcher (will update the build after each change):

```bash
  npm run watch
```

⭐ Dev Server (provides you with a simple web server and the ability to use HMR):

```bash
  npm start
```

### Production environment

⭐ One-time production build with Bundle Analazer stats:

```bash
  npm run build
```

Run production build insdide docker on http://localhost/ (you might need start Docker before run this command):

```bash
  docker compose up -d --build
```

### Formatting & Linting commands

Format & fix the code by ESLint, Prettier, and Stylelint:

```bash
  npm run format
```

Only checks the code for compliance with rules by ESLint, Prettier, and Stylelint:

```bash
  npm run lint
```

You can also use a specific formatter

```bash
  npm run lint:prettier # check for compliance with Prettier rules
  # or
  npm run lint:stylelint # check for compliance with Stylelint rules
  # or
  npm run format:eslint # format & fix the code with ESLint rules
```

Check out more commands at [`package.json` scripts section](./package.json#L7).

### Misc

Debug result ESLint config (output `eslint-output-config.json`):

```bash
  npm run debug:eslint
```

Debug result Stylelint config (output `stylelint-output-config.json`):

```bash
  npm run debug:stylelint
```

Debug result Prettier config (cli output):

```bash
  npm run debug:prettier
```

Generate React component:

```bash
npm run generate
```

Localy check your next release:

```bash
npm run semantic-release:local-check
```

It may be necessary to temporarily remove `@semantic-release/github` plugin from
[`.releaserc.json`](./.releaserc.json)

> If you want to get a more relevant check (with sync to your GitHub repository state), you could run this:
>
> ```bash
> GH_TOKEN=<YOUR_TOKEN> npx semantic-release --dry-run --no-ci
> ```
>
> [Getting GH_TOKEN instruction](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.6/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens)

Create conventional commit:

```bash
  npm run cm
```

Because husky is used in the project, this creates a certain restriction on the naming of scripts, [described here](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli#optional-install-and-run-commitizen-locally).

I personally prefer use [this VS Code Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vivaxy.vscode-conventional-commits) for creating conventional commits.

## Environment comparison

- **Common** - [`webpack.config.js`](./webpack.config.js)
- **Development** - [`webpack.development.js`](./config/webpack/webpack.development.js)
- **Production** - [`webpack.production.js`](./config/webpack/webpack.production.js)

Both environments use [`webpack.config.js`](./webpack.config.js), but each environment has its own features:

| Features                  | Development                    | Production                  |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------ | --------------------------- |
| Devtool                   | ✅ - `eval-source-map`\*       | ❌                          |
| devServer                 | ✅                             | ❌                          |
| ESLint                    | ✅                             | ❌                          |
| TS checks                 | ✅                             | ❌                          |
| CSS implementation\*\*    | ✅ - `style-loader`            | ✅ - `MiniCssExtractPlugin` |
| Proxy backend requests    | ✅ - `Webpack devServer.proxy` | ✅ - `NGINX proxy_pass`     |
| ReactRefreshWebpackPlugin | ✅                             | ❌                          |
| TerserPlugin              | ❌                             | ✅                          |
| CssMinimizerPlugin        | ❌                             | ✅                          |
| HtmlWebpackPlugin minify  | ❌                             | ✅                          |
| BundleAnalyzerPlugin      | ❌                             | ✅                          |
| Output files name         | Default                        | Contenthash                 |
| Favicon\*\*\*             | 🤔                             | ✅                          |

\* You can set `eval` or `false` options to increase build speed, but in this case, you [should manually](https://webpack.js.org/loaders/css-loader/#sourcemap) set `sourceMap` to `true` in `css-loader`, `scss-loader`, and `postcss-loader`.

\*\* `mini-css-extract-plugin` is more often used in **production** mode to get separate css files. For **development** mode (including `webpack-dev-server`) we use `style-loader`, because it injects CSS into the DOM using multiple `style` tags and works faster.

\*\*\* In previous commits, I refused to use the clean-webpack-output plugin because I noticed the presence of a native function that appeared in Webpack _5.20+_ `output.clean`. Unfortunately, it has certain [problems](https://github.com/jantimon/html-webpack-plugin/issues/1639) with the favicon. ~~Therefore, if this bug is not fixed soon, I will return to the previous version (especially since this plugin [was updated recently](https://github.com/johnagan/clean-webpack-plugin/releases/tag/v4.0.0)).~~

## Source

**HTML** - `public/index.html`

**JS/TS** - `src/`

**Global CSS** - `src/styles`

**Assets** - `src/assets` _- all assets that used directly in target code_

> **Fonts** - `src/assets/fonts`
>
> **Images/SVG** - `src/assets/images`
>
> **Other Assets** - `src/assets/*`

**Static files** - `public/static` _- files in this folder will be copy to dist root as it is (without any processing). Eg `robots.txt`._

## Useful tips 💡

- SVG import

  To import SVG as a React component, use deafult svg extension:

  ```js
  import SvgComponent from '@assets/images/example.svg' // props => React.createElement("svg",...
  ```

  to import SVG as an asset (url), add resource query (`?url`) to svg extension:

  in _TSX/JSX/JS/TS_ files:

  ```js
  import svgSrc from '@assets/images/example.svg?url' // data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bW...
  ```

  in _CSS/SCSS_ files:

  ```css
  .svg {
    background-image: url('@assets/images/example.svg?url'); /* data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bW...*/
  }
  ```

- [`babel.config.cjs`](./babel.config.cjs)

  I set `useBuiltIns: 'usage'` which automatically detects the polyfills needed to be based on the language features used in your source code. This ensures only the minimum amount of polyfills are included in your final bundle. Additionaly i set [`proposals: true`](https://babeljs.io/docs/babel-preset-env#corejs), for `Object.groupBy`, since not all major browsers currently support it _(31.10.2023)_.

  ```js
  presets: [
    [
      '@babel/preset-env',
      {
        useBuiltIns: 'usage',
        corejs: { version: '3.33', proposals: true }, // The version string can be any supported core-js versions
      },
    ],
  ]
  ```

- [`webpack.production.js`](./config/webpack.production.js)

  Set these options in `TerserPlugin` to remove comments from code and prevent `LICENSE.txt` files creation.

  ```js
  optimization: {
    minimizer: [
      new TerserPlugin({
        terserOptions: {
          format: {
            comments: false,
          },
        },
        extractComments: false,
      })
    ],
  },
  ```

  - [`webpack.config.js`](./webpack.config.js)

  In production mode eg `HTMLWebpackPlugin` minify your HTML code by default

  I'm decide to remove [`context`](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/entry-context/#context) field from config, since [`@pmmmwh/react-refresh-webpack-plugin`](https://github.com/pmmmwh/react-refresh-webpack-plugin) & [`fork-ts-checker-webpack-plugin`](https://github.com/TypeStrong/fork-ts-checker-webpack-plugin) incorrectly infer root directory, while set context to `src` folder.

  - **Formatting & Linting commands**

  _ESLint_ & _Prettier_ & _Stylelint_ formatting works separately. So, when you run `npm run format:eslint` it will only fix _ESLint_ rules, but not apply Prettier rules formatting. If you want both run `npm run format:eslint && npm run format:prettier` or `npm run format`, which also includes _Stylelint_ formatting.

  To understand which extensions are used in each command, check out [`package.json` scripts section](./package.json#L7).

  - **CI**

  If you wish to make a prerelease, you can begin working in the `alpha` or `beta` branches.

  If you need to bypass the git commit hooks, use the `-n` or `--no-verify` option. For example:

  ```bash
  git commit -n -m "message" # or git commit --no-verify -m "message"
  ```

  If you need to bypass `husky` checks, pass the environment variable `HUSKY=0`. For example (macOS/Linux):

  ```bash
  HUSKY=0 git commit -m "message" # or for Windows: cross-env HUSKY=0 git commit -m "message"
  ```

  If you want to skip `semantic-release` checks for commit, you could add scope - `no-release`. For example:

  ```bash
  git commit -m "chore(no-release): message"
  ```

  If you want to skip [`release job`](<(./.github/workflows/release.yml)>) for commit, you could add `[skip ci]` text in your commit message. For example:

  ```bash
  git commit -m "chore: message [skip ci]"
  ```

  If you want ti skip all above:

  ```bash
  git commit -n -m "chore(no-release): message [skip ci]"
  ```
