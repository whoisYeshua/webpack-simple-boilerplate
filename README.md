  Expanded by [`cz-conventional-changelog`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cz-conventional-changelog) - A commitizen propmpts adapter for the Angular version of [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)

### [Plop](https://plopjs.com/)

- [`plop`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/plop) - micro-generator framework that makes it easy to create files

## ⚠️ Requirements ⚠️

Since some Webpack plugins supported only by `Node.js` version ≥ `14.15` and this boilerplate use [`lockfileVersion` 3](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v9/configuring-npm/package-lock-json#lockfileversion), you need [`Node.js 16.13 and above`](https://nodejs.org/en/) to prepare for future changes.

## ⏬ Installation

1. Clone or download the repo
2. Browse the downloaded directory
3. Install dependencies through `npm`
   ```bash
    npm i
   ```

## ⏩ Commands

### Development environment

One-time development build:

```bash
  npm run dev
```

Watcher (will update the build after each change):

```bash
  npm run watch
```

⭐ Dev Server (provides you with a simple web server and the ability to use HMR):

```bash
  npm start
```

### Production environment

⭐ One-time production build:

```bash
  npm run build
```

### Formatting & Linting commands

Format & fix the code by ESLint, Prettier, and Stylelint:

```bash
  npm run format
```

Only checks the code for compliance with rules by ESLint, Prettier, and Stylelint:

```bash
  npm run lint
```

You can also use a specific formatter

```bash
  npm run lint:prettier # check for compliance with Prettier rules
  # or
  npm run lint:stylelint # check for compliance with Stylelint rules
  # or
  npm run format:eslint # format & fix the code with ESLint rules
```

Check out more commands at [`package.json` scripts section](https://github.com/whoisYeshua/webpack-simple-boilerplate/blob/master/package.json#L7).

### CI

Create conventional commit:

```bash
  npm run cm
```

Because husky is used in the project, this creates a certain restriction on the naming of scripts, [described here](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli#optional-install-and-run-commitizen-locally).

I personally prefer use [this VS Code Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vivaxy.vscode-conventional-commits) for creating conventional commits.

### Misc

Generate React component:

```bash
npm run generate
```

## Environment comparison

- **Common** - [`webpack.config.js`](https://github.com/whoisYeshua/webpack-simple-boilerplate/blob/master/webpack.config.js)
- **Development** - [`webpack.development.js`](https://github.com/whoisYeshua/webpack-simple-boilerplate/blob/master/config/webpack.development.js)
- **Production** - [`webpack.production.js`](https://github.com/whoisYeshua/webpack-simple-boilerplate/blob/master/config/webpack.production.js)

Both environments use [`webpack.config.js`](https://github.com/whoisYeshua/webpack-simple-boilerplate/blob/master/webpack.config.js), but each environment has its own features:

| Features                  | Development         | Production                  |
| ------------------------- | ------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Devtool                   | ✅ - `source-map`\* | ❌                          |
| devServer                 | ✅                  | ❌                          |
| ESLint                    | ✅                  | ❌                          |
| CSS implementation\*\*    | ✅ - `style-loader` | ✅ - `MiniCssExtractPlugin` |
| ReactRefreshWebpackPlugin | ✅                  | ❌                          |
| TerserPlugin              | ❌                  | ✅                          |
| CssMinimizerPlugin        | ❌                  | ✅                          |
| HtmlWebpackPlugin minify  | ❌                  | ✅                          |
| BundleAnalyzerPlugin      | ❌                  | ✅                          |
| Output files name         | Default             | Contenthash                 |
| Favicon\*\*\*             | 🤔                  | ✅                          |

\* You can set `eval-source-map` or other options to increase build speed, but in this case, you should manually set `sourceMap` to `true` in `css-loader`, `scss-loader`, and `postcss-loader`.

\*\* `mini-css-extract-plugin` is more often used in **production** mode to get separate css files. For **development** mode (including `webpack-dev-server`) we use `style-loader`, because it injects CSS into the DOM using multiple `style` tags and works faster.

\*\*\* In previous commits, I refused to use the clean-webpack-output plugin because I noticed the presence of a native function that appeared in Webpack _5.20+_ `output.clean`. Unfortunately, it has certain [problems](https://github.com/jantimon/html-webpack-plugin/issues/1639) with the favicon. Therefore, if this bug is not fixed soon, I will return to the previous version (especially since this plugin [was updated recently](https://github.com/johnagan/clean-webpack-plugin/releases/tag/v4.0.0)).

## Source

**HTML** - `public/index.html`

**JS/TS** - `src/`

**Global CSS** - `src/styles`

**Assets** - `src/assets` _- all assets that used directly in target code_

> **Fonts** - `src/assets/fonts`
>
> **Images** - `src/assets/images`
>
> **Other Assets** - `src/assets/*`

**Static files** - `public/static` _- files in this folder will be copy to dist root as it is (without any processing). Eg `robots.txt`._

## Useful tips 💡

- [`babel.config.cjs`](https://github.com/whoisYeshua/webpack-simple-boilerplate/blob/master/babel.config.cjs)

  I set `useBuiltIns: 'usage'` which automatically detects the polyfills needed to be based on the language features used in your source code. This ensures only the minimum amount of polyfills are included in your final bundle.

  ```js
  presets: [
    [
      '@babel/preset-env',
      {
        useBuiltIns: 'usage',
        corejs: '3.23', // The version string can be any supported core-js versions
      },
    ],
  ]
  ```

- [`webpack.production.js`](https://github.com/whoisYeshua/webpack-simple-boilerplate/blob/master/config/webpack.production.js)

  Set these options in `TerserPlugin` to remove comments from code and prevent `*LICENSE.txt` files creation.

  ```js
  optimization: {
    minimizer: [
      new TerserPlugin({
        terserOptions: {
          format: {
            comments: false,
          },
        },
        extractComments: false,
      })
    ],
  },
  ```

  - [`webpack.config.js`](https://github.com/whoisYeshua/webpack-simple-boilerplate/blob/master/webpack.config.js)

  In production mode eg `HTMLWebpackPlugin` minify your HTML code by default

  - **Formatting & Linting commands**

  _ESLint_ & _Prettier_ formatting works separately. So, when you run `npm run format:eslint` it will only fix _ESLint_ rules, but not apply Prettier rules formatting. If you want both run `npm run format:eslint && npm run format:prettier` or `npm run format`, which also includes _Stylelint_ formatting.

  _Stylelint_ & _Prettier_ formatting works together. So, when you run `npm run fromat:stylelint` it will run _Stylelint_ rules check and fix and then run _Prettier_ formatting _(It works thanks to [`stylelint-prettier`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/stylelint-prettier))_. _Note: `npm run format:prettier` will not affect `css` or `scss` files, my Stylelint build uses Prettier under the hood as mentioned above._

  To understand which extensions are used in each command, check out [`package.json` scripts section](https://github.com/whoisYeshua/webpack-simple-boilerplate/blob/master/package.json#L7).

## 📝 To Do

- [x] - Add React Hot Reloading support - [`react-refresh-webpack-plugin`](https://github.com/pmmmwh/react-refresh-webpack-plugin/)

- [] - Add [`semantic-release`](https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/semantic-release/)
